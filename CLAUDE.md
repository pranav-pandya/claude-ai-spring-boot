# Project Instructions

- Always use the latest versions of dependencies.
- Always write Java code as the Spring Boot application.
- Always use Maven for dependency management.
- Always create test cases for the generated code both positive and negative.
- Always generate the CircleCI pipeline in the .circleci directory to verify the code.
- Minimize the amount of code generated.
- The Maven artifact name must be the same as the parent directory name.
- Use semantic versioning for the Maven project. Each time you generate a new version, bump the PATCH section of the version number.
- Use `pl.piomin.services` as the group ID for the Maven project and base Java package.
- Do not use the Lombok library.
- Generate the Docker Compose file to run all components used by the application.
